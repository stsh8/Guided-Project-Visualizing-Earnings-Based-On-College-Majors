# Guided-Project-Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors
In this guided project, we'll explore how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations.
We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.

Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset like:

Do students in more popular majors make more money?
Using scatter plots
How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
Using histograms
Which category of majors have the most students?
Using bar plots
We'll explore how to do these and more while primarily working in pandas. Before we start creating data visualizations, let's import the libraries we need and remove rows containing null values.
